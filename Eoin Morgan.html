<p> <br> Eoin Joseph Gerard Morgan CBE (born 10 September 1986) is an Irish-born cricketer who plays for (and captains) the England cricket team in limited overs cricket, Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League, Middlesex in the T20 Blast and London Spirit in The Hundred. Under his captaincy, England won the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, the first time they won the tournament.
A left-handed batter, he plays county cricket for Middlesex and has played for England's Test, One Day International (ODI), and Twenty20 International (T20I) teams. He previously played for the Ireland cricket team in ODIs, and was the first player to score an ODI hundred for two nations.
After Alastair Cook was removed from the ODI captaincy on 19 December 2014, Morgan was named as the England captain for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, having already captained England in ODIs and T20Is as a stand-in. He is the only England captain to have scored more than 4 ODI centuries.
As of May 2021, Morgan is the all-time leading run scorer and most-capped player for England in both ODI and T20I matches. He also holds the England record for the fastest fifty in ODIs and during the 2019 ICC World Cup he scored the highest number of sixes in an ODI innings, with 17 sixes against Afghanistan.
In March 2021, Morgan became the first male cricketer for England to play in 100 T20Is (57 as captain), in the third match against India.</p>
